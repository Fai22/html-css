<p class="clear">To understand the nature and meaning of beauty It is necessary to understand the philosophy of aesthetics In aesthetics there are many groups of philosophers. including those who believe that beauty is subjective, and those who believe that beauty has absolute, objective values.
 There were also philosophers such as Robert Schumann who were both composers and critics. with the view that beauty can be classified into two categories is natural beauty and beauty born by man. Natural beauty is about experiencing and recognizing the beauty that exists in nature. But beauty created by man is something man creates and involves in nature. Schumann also said that in art There were two kinds of beauty. Only natural beauty is emotional beauty. And the beauty created by humans is the understanding of that work of art.</p>
